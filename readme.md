This is just a small program i made after i watched
[Generating π from 1,000 random numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBhSi_PwHU).

It generates a bunch of random numbers then it calculates the GCD(Greatest Common Divisor) and does some other stuff and out comes something looking like π

###### To run the program

```
$ cd THE LOCATION OF Program.exe
$ mono64 Program.exe
